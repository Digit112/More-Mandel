# More Mandel

So named because I have done this many times. This is the best Mandelbrot renderer I have. This is in terms of functionality, not usability.

The parameters are modified in the source code, near the bottom in main()

The source code requires NVCC to compile for an NVIDIA GPU. I will likely modify it to be CPU-capable in the future, but this will cause it to be extremely slow.
